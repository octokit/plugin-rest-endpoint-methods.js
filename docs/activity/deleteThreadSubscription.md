# Delete a thread subscription

Mutes all future notifications for a conversation until you comment on the thread or get an **@mention**. If you are watching the repository of the thread, you will still receive notifications. To ignore future notifications for a repository you are watching, use the [Set a thread subscription](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/notifications/#set-a-thread-subscription) endpoint and set `ignore` to `true`.

```js
octokit.activity.deleteThreadSubscription({
  thread_id,
});
```

## Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>required</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>thread_id</td><td>yes</td><td>

</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
