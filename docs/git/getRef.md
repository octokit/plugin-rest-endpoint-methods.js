# Get a reference

Returns a single reference from your Git database. The `:ref` in the URL must be formatted as `heads/<branch name>` for branches and `tags/<tag name>` for tags. If the `:ref` doesn't match an existing ref, a `404` is returned.

**Note:** You need to explicitly [request a pull request](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#get-a-single-pull-request) to trigger a test merge commit, which checks the mergeability of pull requests. For more information, see "[Checking mergeability of pull requests](https://developer.github.com/v3/git/#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)".

To get the reference for a branch named `skunkworkz/featureA`, the endpoint route is:

```js
octokit.git.getRef({
  owner,
  repo,
  ref,
});
```
