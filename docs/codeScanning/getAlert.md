# Get a code scanning alert

Gets a single code scanning alert. You must use an access token with the `security_events` scope to use this endpoint. GitHub Apps must have the `security_events` read permission to use this endpoint.

**Deprecation notice**:
The instances field is deprecated and will, in future, not be included in the response for this endpoint. The example response reflects this change. The same information can now be retrieved via a GET request to the URL specified by `instances_url`.

```js
octokit.codeScanning.getAlert({
  owner,
  repo,
  alert_number,
});
```
