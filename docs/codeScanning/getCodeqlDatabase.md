# Get a CodeQL database for a repository

Gets a CodeQL database for a language in a repository.

By default this endpoint returns JSON metadata about the CodeQL database. To
download the CodeQL database binary content, set the `Accept` header of the request
to [`application/zip`](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types), and make sure
your HTTP client is configured to follow redirects or use the `Location` header
to make a second request to get the redirect URL.

For private repositories, you must use an access token with the `security_events` scope.
For public repositories, you can use tokens with the `security_events` or `public_repo` scope.
GitHub Apps must have the `contents` read permission to use this endpoint.

```js
octokit.rest.codeScanning.getCodeqlDatabase({
  owner,
  repo,
  language,
});
```
