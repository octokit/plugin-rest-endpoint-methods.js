# Get all requested reviewers for a pull request

Gets the users or teams whose review is requested for a pull request. Once a requested reviewer submits a review, they are no longer considered a requested reviewer. Their review will instead be returned by the [List reviews for a pull request](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/reviews#list-reviews-for-a-pull-request) operation.

```js
octokit.rest.pulls.listRequestedReviewers({
  owner,
  repo,
  pull_number,
});
```

## Parameters
