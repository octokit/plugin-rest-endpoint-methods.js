# Create a reply for a review comment

Creates a reply to a review comment for a pull request. For the `comment_id`, provide the ID of the review comment you are replying to. This must be the ID of a _top-level review comment_, not a reply to that comment. Replies to replies are not supported.

This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. See "[Secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#secondary-rate-limits)" and "[Dealing with secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-integrators#dealing-with-secondary-rate-limits)" for details.
