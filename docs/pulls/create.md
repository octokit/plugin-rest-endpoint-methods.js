# Create a pull request

Draft pull requests are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, GitHub Pro, and legacy per-repository billing plans, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.

To open or update a pull request in a public repository, you must have write access to the head or the source branch. For organization-owned repositories, you must be a member of the organization that owns the repository to open or update a pull request.

This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. For more information, see "[Rate limits for the API](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api#about-secondary-rate-limits)" and "[Best practices for using the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api)."

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

- **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
- **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.
- **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include `body_html`.
- **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and `body_html`.
- **`application/vnd.github.diff`**: For more information, see "[git-diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff)" in the Git documentation. If a diff is corrupt, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). Include the repository name and pull request ID in your message.
