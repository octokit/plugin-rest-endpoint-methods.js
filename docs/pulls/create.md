# Create a pull request

Draft pull requests are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, GitHub Pro, and legacy per-repository billing plans, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://help.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.

To open or update a pull request in a public repository, you must have write access to the head or the source branch. For organization-owned repositories, you must be a member of the organization that owns the repository to open or update a pull request.

You can create a new pull request.

This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in abuse rate limiting. See "[Abuse rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#abuse-rate-limits)" and "[Dealing with abuse rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-integrators#dealing-with-rate-limits)" for details.

```js
octokit.rest.pulls.create({
  owner,
  repo,
