# List commits on a pull request

Lists a maximum of 250 commits for a pull request. To receive a complete
commit list for pull requests with more than 250 commits, use the [List commits](https://docs.github.com/rest/commits/commits#list-commits)
endpoint.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

- **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
- **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.
- **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include `body_html`.
- **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and `body_html`.
- **`application/vnd.github.diff`**: For more information, see "[git-diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff)" in the Git documentation. If a diff is corrupt, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). Include the repository name and pull request ID in your message.
