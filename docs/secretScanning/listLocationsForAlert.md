# List locations for a secret scanning alert

Lists all locations for a given secret scanning alert for an eligible repository.
To use this endpoint, you must be an administrator for the repository or for the organization that owns the repository, and you must use a personal access token with the `repo` scope or `security_events` scope.
For public repositories, you may instead use the `public_repo` scope.

GitHub Apps must have the `secret_scanning_alerts` read permission to use this endpoint.

```js
octokit.rest.secretScanning.listLocationsForAlert({
  owner,
  repo,
  alert_number,
});
```
