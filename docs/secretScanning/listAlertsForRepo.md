# List secret scanning alerts for a repository

Lists secret scanning alerts for an eligible repository, from newest to oldest.
To use this endpoint, you must be an administrator for the repository or for the organization that owns the repository, and you must use a personal access token with the `repo` scope or `security_events` scope.
For public repositories, you may instead use the `public_repo` scope.

GitHub Apps must have the `secret_scanning_alerts` read permission to use this endpoint.

```js
octokit.rest.secretScanning.listAlertsForRepo({
  owner,
  repo,
});
```
