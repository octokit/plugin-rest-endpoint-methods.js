# Create reaction for a team discussion

Create a reaction to a [team discussion](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/teams#discussions). OAuth access tokens require the `write:discussion` [scope](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/). A response with an HTTP `200` status means that you already added the reaction type to this team discussion.

**Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `POST /organizations/:org_id/team/:team_id/discussions/:discussion_number/reactions`.

```js
octokit.rest.reactions.createForTeamDiscussionInOrg({
  org,
  team_slug,
  discussion_number,
  content,
});
```
