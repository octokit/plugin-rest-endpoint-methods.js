# Get your current rate limit status

**Note:** Accessing this endpoint does not count against your REST API rate limit.

**Understanding your rate limit status**

The Search API has a [custom rate limit](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#rate-limit), separate from the rate limit governing the rest of the REST API. The GraphQL API also has a [custom rate limit](https://developer.github.com/v4/guides/resource-limitations/#rate-limit) that is separate from and calculated differently than rate limits in the REST API.

For these reasons, the Rate Limit API response categorizes your rate limit. Under `resources`, you'll see four objects:

- The `core` object provides your rate limit status for all non-search-related resources in the REST API.
- The `search` object provides your rate limit status for the [Search API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/).
- The `graphql` object provides your rate limit status for the [GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/).
- The `integration_manifest` object provides your rate limit status for the [GitHub App Manifest code conversion](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-github-apps-from-a-manifest/#3-you-exchange-the-temporary-code-to-retrieve-the-app-configuration) endpoint.

For more information on the headers and values in the rate limit response, see "[Rate limiting](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting)."

The `rate` object (shown at the bottom of the response above) is deprecated.

If you're writing new API client code or updating existing code, you should use the `core` object instead of the `rate` object. The `core` object contains the same information that is present in the `rate` object.

```js
octokit.rateLimit.get();
