# Download a repository archive (zip)

**Deprecated:** This method has been renamed to repos.downloadZipballArchive

Gets a redirect URL to download a zip archive for a repository. If you omit `:ref`, the repositoryâ€™s default branch (usually
`main`) will be used. Please make sure your HTTP framework is configured to follow redirects or you will need to use
the `Location` header to make a second `GET` request.

**Note**: For private repositories, these links are temporary and expire after five minutes. If the repository is empty, you will receive a 404 when you follow the redirect.

```js
octokit.rest.repos.downloadArchive({
  owner,
  repo,
  ref,
});
```
