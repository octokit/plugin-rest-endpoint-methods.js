# List custom deployment rule integrations available for an environment

Gets all custom deployment protection rule integrations that are available for an environment. Anyone with read access to the repository can use this endpoint.

For more information about environments, see "[Using environments for deployment](https://docs.github.com/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)."

For more information about the app that is providing this custom deployment rule, see "[GET an app](https://docs.github.com/rest/apps/apps#get-an-app)".

OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint with a private repository.
