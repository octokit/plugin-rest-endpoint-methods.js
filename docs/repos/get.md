# Get a repository

When you pass the `scarlet-witch-preview` media type, requests to get a repository will also return the repository's code of conduct if it can be detected from the repository's code of conduct file.

The `parent` and `source` objects are present when the repository is a fork. `parent` is the repository this repository was forked from, `source` is the ultimate source for the network.

```js
octokit.rest.repos.get({
  owner,
  repo,
});
```

## Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>required</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>owner</td><td>yes</td><td>

</td></tr>
<tr><td>repo</td><td>yes</td><td>

</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
