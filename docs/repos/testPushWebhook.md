# Test the push repository webhook

This will trigger the hook with the latest push to the current repository if the hook is subscribed to `push` events. If the hook is not subscribed to `push` events, the server will respond with 204 but no test POST will be generated.

**Note**: Previously `/repos/:owner/:repo/hooks/:hook_id/test`

```js
octokit.rest.repos.testPushWebhook({
  owner,
  repo,
  hook_id,
});
```
