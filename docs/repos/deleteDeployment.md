# Delete a deployment

To ensure there can always be an active deployment, you can only delete an _inactive_ deployment. Anyone with `repo` or `repo_deployment` scopes can delete an inactive deployment.

To set a deployment as inactive, you must:

- Create a new deployment that is active so that the system has a record of the current state, then delete the previously active deployment.
- Mark the active deployment as inactive by adding any non-successful deployment status.

For more information, see "[Create a deployment](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/#create-a-deployment)" and "[Create a deployment status](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/#create-a-deployment-status)."

```js
octokit.repos.deleteDeployment({
  owner,
  repo,
  deployment_id,
});
```
