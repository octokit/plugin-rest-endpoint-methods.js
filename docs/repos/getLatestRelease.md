# Get the latest release

View the latest published full release for the repository.

The latest release is the most recent non-prerelease, non-draft release, sorted by the `created_at` attribute. The `created_at` attribute is the date of the commit used for the release, and not the date when the release was drafted or published.

octokit.repos.getLatestRelease({
  owner,
  repo
