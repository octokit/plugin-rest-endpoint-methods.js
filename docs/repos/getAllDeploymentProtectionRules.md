# Get all deployment protection rules for an environment

Gets all custom deployment protection rules that are enabled for an environment. Anyone with read access to the repository can use this endpoint. If the repository is private and you want to use a personal access token (classic), you must use an access token with the `repo` scope. GitHub Apps and fine-grained personal access tokens must have the `actions:read` permission to use this endpoint. For more information about environments, see "[Using environments for deployment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)."

For more information about the app that is providing this custom deployment rule, see the [documentation for the `GET /apps/{app_slug}` endpoint](https://docs.github.com/rest/apps/apps#get-an-app).

```js
octokit.rest.repos.getAllDeploymentProtectionRules({
  environment_name,
  repo,
  owner,
});
```
