# Add a repository collaborator

This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. See "[Secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#secondary-rate-limits)" and "[Dealing with secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-integrators#dealing-with-secondary-rate-limits)" for details.

Adding an outside collaborator may be restricted by enterprise administrators. For more information, see "[Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise](https://docs.github.com/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-inviting-outside-collaborators-to-repositories)."

For more information on permission levels, see "[Repository permission levels for an organization](https://docs.github.com/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization)". There are restrictions on which permissions can be granted to organization members when an organization base role is in place. In this case, the permission being given must be equal to or higher than the org base permission. Otherwise, the request will fail with:

```
Cannot assign {member} permission of {role name}
```

Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see "[HTTP verbs](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#http-verbs)."

The invitee will receive a notification that they have been invited to the repository, which they must accept or decline. They may do this via the notifications page, the email they receive, or by using the [repository invitations API endpoints](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#invitations).

**Updating an existing collaborator's permission level**

The endpoint can also be used to change the permissions of an existing collaborator without first removing and re-adding the collaborator. To change the permissions, use the same endpoint and pass a different `permission` parameter. The response will be a `204`, with no other indication that the permission level changed.

**Rate limits**

You are limited to sending 50 invitations to a repository per 24 hour period. Note there is no limit if you are inviting organization members to an organization repository.

```js
octokit.rest.repos.addCollaborator({
  owner,
  repo,
  username,
});
```
