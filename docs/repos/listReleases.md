# List releases

This returns a list of releases, which does not include regular Git tags that have not been associated with a release. To get a list of Git tags, use the [Repository Tags API](https://docs.github.com/rest/repos/repos#list-repository-tags).

Information about published releases are available to everyone. Only users with push access will receive listings for draft releases.

octokit.rest.repos.listReleases({
  owner,
  repo,
});
