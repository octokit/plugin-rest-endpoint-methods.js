# Create a custom deployment protection rule on an environment

Enable a custom deployment protection rule for an environment.

The authenticated user must have admin or owner permissions to the repository to use this endpoint.

For more information about the app that is providing this custom deployment rule, see the [documentation for the `GET /apps/{app_slug}` endpoint](https://docs.github.com/rest/apps/apps#get-an-app).

OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.

```js
octokit.rest.repos.createDeploymentProtectionRule({
  environment_name,
  repo,
  owner,
});
```
