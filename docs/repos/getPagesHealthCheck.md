# Get a DNS health check for GitHub Pages

Gets a health check of the DNS settings for the `CNAME` record configured for a repository's GitHub Pages.

The first request to this endpoint returns a `202 Accepted` status and starts an asynchronous background task to get the results for the domain. After the background task completes, subsequent requests to this endpoint return a `200 OK` status with the health check results in the response.

To use this endpoint, you must be a repository administrator, maintainer, or have the 'manage GitHub Pages settings' permission. A token with the `repo` scope or Pages write permission is required. GitHub Apps must have the `administrative:write` and `pages:write` permissions.

```js
octokit.rest.repos.getPagesHealthCheck({
  owner,
  repo,
});
```
