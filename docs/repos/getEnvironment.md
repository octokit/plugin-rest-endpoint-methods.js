# Get an environment

**Note:** To get information about name patterns that branches must match in order to deploy to this environment, see "[Get a deployment branch policy](/rest/deployments/branch-policies#get-a-deployment-branch-policy)."

Anyone with read access to the repository can use this endpoint.

OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint with a private repository.

```js
octokit.rest.repos.getEnvironment({
  owner,
  repo,
  environment_name,
});
```

## Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>

      <th>required</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

    <tr><td>owner</td><td>yes</td><td>

The account owner of the repository. The name is not case sensitive.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>repo</td><td>yes</td><td>

The name of the repository without the `.git` extension. The name is not case sensitive.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>environment_name</td><td>yes</td><td>

The name of the environment. The name must be URL encoded. For example, any slashes in the name must be replaced with `%2F`.

</td></tr>
  </tbody>
