# Delete a file

Deletes a file in a repository.

You can provide an additional `committer` parameter, which is an object containing information about the committer. Or, you can provide an `author` parameter, which is an object containing information about the author.

The `author` section is optional and is filled in with the `committer` information if omitted. If the `committer` information is omitted, the authenticated user's information is used.

You must provide values for both `name` and `email`, whether you choose to use `author` or `committer`. Otherwise, you'll receive a `422` status code.

**Note:** If you use this endpoint and the "[Create or update file contents](https://docs.github.com/rest/repos/contents/#create-or-update-file-contents)" endpoint in parallel, the concurrent requests will conflict and you will receive errors. You must use these endpoints serially instead.

```js
octokit.rest.repos.deleteFile({
  owner,
  repo,
  path,
  message,
  sha,
});
```
