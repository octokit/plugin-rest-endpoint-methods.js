# Get the weekly commit count

Returns the total commit counts for the `owner` and total commit counts in `all`. `all` is everyone combined, including the `owner` in the last 52 weeks. If you'd like to get the commit counts for non-owners, you can subtract `owner` from `all`.

The array order is oldest week (index 0) to most recent week.

```js
octokit.rest.repos.getParticipationStats({
  owner,
  repo,
});
```

## Parameters

      <th>required</th>
      <th>description</th>

The account owner of the repository. The name is not case sensitive.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>repo</td><td>yes</td><td>

The name of the repository. The name is not case sensitive.
