# Get the weekly commit count

Returns the total commit counts for the `owner` and total commit counts in `all`. `all` is everyone combined, including the `owner` in the last 52 weeks. If you'd like to get the commit counts for non-owners, you can subtract `owner` from `all`.

The array order is oldest week (index 0) to most recent week.

```js
octokit.repos.getParticipationStats({
  owner,
  repo,
});
```

## Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>required</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>owner</td><td>yes</td><td>

</td></tr>
<tr><td>repo</td><td>yes</td><td>

</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
