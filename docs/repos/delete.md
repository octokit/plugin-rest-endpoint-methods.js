# Delete a repository

Deleting a repository requires admin access. If OAuth is used, the `delete_repo` scope is required.

If an organization owner has configured the organization to prevent members from deleting organization-owned
repositories, you will get a `403 Forbidden` response.

```js
octokit.repos.delete({
  owner,
  repo,
});
```

## Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>required</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>owner</td><td>yes</td><td>

</td></tr>
<tr><td>repo</td><td>yes</td><td>

</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
