# Get your public key

Gets your public key, which you must store. You need your public key to use other secrets endpoints. Use the returned `key` to encrypt your secrets. Anyone with read access to the repository can use this endpoint. If the repository is private you must use an access token with the `repo` scope. GitHub Apps must have the `secrets` permission to use this endpoint.

```js
octokit.actions.getPublicKey({
  owner,
  repo,
});
```
