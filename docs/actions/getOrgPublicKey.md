# Get an organization public key

Gets your public key, which you need to encrypt secrets. You need to
encrypt a secret before you can create or update secrets.

The authenticated user must have collaborator access to a repository to create, update, or read secrets.

OAuth tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the`admin:org` scope to use this endpoint. If the repository is private, OAuth tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.

```js
octokit.rest.actions.getOrgPublicKey({
  org,
});
```

## Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>required</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>org</td><td>yes</td><td>

The organization name. The name is not case sensitive.

</table>
