# Set allowed actions and reusable workflows for a repository

Sets the actions and reusable workflows that are allowed in a repository. To use this endpoint, the repository permission policy for `allowed_actions` must be configured to `selected`. For more information, see "[Set GitHub Actions permissions for a repository](#set-github-actions-permissions-for-a-repository)."

OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.

```js
octokit.rest.actions.setAllowedActionsRepository({
  owner,
  repo,
});
```
