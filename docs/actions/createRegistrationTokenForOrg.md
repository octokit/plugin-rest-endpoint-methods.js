# Create a registration token for an organization

**Warning:** The self-hosted runners API for organizations is currently in public beta and subject to change.

Returns a token that you can pass to the `config` script. The token expires after one hour. Anyone with admin access to the organization can use this endpoint. GitHub Apps must have the `self-hosted runners:write` organization permission to use this endpoint.

Configure your self-hosted runner, replacing `TOKEN` with the registration token provided by this endpoint.

```js
octokit.actions.createRegistrationTokenForOrg({
  org,
});
```

## Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>required</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
