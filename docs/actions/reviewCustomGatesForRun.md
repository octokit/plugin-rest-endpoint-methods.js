# Review custom deployment protection rules for a workflow run

Approve or reject custom deployment protection rules provided by a GitHub App for a workflow run. For more information, see "[Using environments for deployment](https://docs.github.com/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)."

**Note:** GitHub Apps can only review their own custom deployment protection rules.
To approve or reject pending deployments that are waiting for review from a specific person or team, see [`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/pending_deployments`](/rest/actions/workflow-runs#review-pending-deployments-for-a-workflow-run).

GitHub Apps must have read and write permission for **Deployments** to use this endpoint.

```js
octokit.rest.actions.reviewCustomGatesForRun({
  owner,
  repo,
  run_id,
});
```
