# List jobs for a workflow run attempt

Lists jobs for a specific workflow run attempt. Anyone with read access to the repository can use this endpoint. If the repository is private you must use an access token with the `repo` scope. GitHub Apps must have the `actions:read` permission to use this endpoint. You can use parameters to narrow the list of results. For more information about using parameters, see [Parameters](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#parameters).

```js
octokit.rest.actions.listJobsForWorkflowRunAttempt({
  owner,
  repo,
  run_id,
