# Enable a workflow

Enables a workflow and sets the `state` of the workflow to `active`. You can replace `workflow_id` with the workflow file name. For example, you could use `main.yaml`.

You must authenticate using an access token with the `repo` scope to use this endpoint. GitHub Apps must have the `actions:write` permission to use this endpoint.

```js
octokit.rest.actions.enableWorkflow({
  owner,
  repo,
  workflow_id,
});
```
