# Get a workflow

Gets a specific workflow. You can replace `workflow_id` with the workflow file name. For example, you could use `main.yaml`. Anyone with read access to the repository can use this endpoint. If the repository is private you must use an access token with the `repo` scope. GitHub Apps must have the `actions:read` permission to use this endpoint.

```js
octokit.rest.actions.getWorkflow({
  owner,
  repo,
  workflow_id,
});
```
