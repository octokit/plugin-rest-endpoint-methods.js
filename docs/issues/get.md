# Get an issue

The API returns a [`301 Moved Permanently` status](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api#follow-redirects) if the issue was
[transferred](https://docs.github.com/articles/transferring-an-issue-to-another-repository/) to another repository. If
the issue was transferred to or deleted from a repository where the authenticated user lacks read access, the API
returns a `404 Not Found` status. If the issue was deleted from a repository where the authenticated user has read
access, the API returns a `410 Gone` status. To receive webhook events for transferred and deleted issues, subscribe
to the [`issues`](https://docs.github.com/webhooks/event-payloads/#issues) webhook.

> [!NOTE]
> GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

- **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
- **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.
- **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include `body_html`.
- **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and `body_html`.

```js
octokit.rest.issues.get({
  owner,
