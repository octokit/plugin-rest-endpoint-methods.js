# Create an issue comment

You can use the REST API to create comments on issues and pull requests. Every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request.

This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications).
Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting.
For more information, see "[Rate limits for the API](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api#about-secondary-rate-limits)"
and "[Best practices for using the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api)."

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

- **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
- **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.
- **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include `body_html`.
- **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and `body_html`.

```js
octokit.rest.issues.createComment({
  owner,
