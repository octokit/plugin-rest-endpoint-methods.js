# Create an issue

Any user with pull access to a repository can create an issue. If [issues are disabled in the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/disabling-issues/), the API returns a `410 Gone` status.

This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://help.github.com/articles/about-notifications/). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in abuse rate limiting. See "[Abuse rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#abuse-rate-limits)" and "[Dealing with abuse rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-integrators#dealing-with-abuse-rate-limits)" for details.
