# Create an issue

Any user with pull access to a repository can create an issue. If [issues are disabled in the repository](https://docs.github.com/articles/disabling-issues/), the API returns a `410 Gone` status.

This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. See "[Secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#secondary-rate-limits)" and "[Dealing with secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-integrators#dealing-with-secondary-rate-limits)" for details.

```js
octokit.rest.issues.create({
  owner,
  repo,
  title,
});
```
