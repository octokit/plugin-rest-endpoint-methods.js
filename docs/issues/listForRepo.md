# List repository issues

List issues in a repository.

**Note**: GitHub's REST API v3 considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the `pull_request` key.

Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.

```js
octokit.issues.listForRepo({
  owner,
  repo,
});
```
