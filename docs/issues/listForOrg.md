# List organization issues assigned to the authenticated user

List issues in an organization assigned to the authenticated user.

**Note**: GitHub's REST API v3 considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this
reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by
the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull
request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/pulls#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.

```js
octokit.issues.listForOrg({
  org,
});
```
