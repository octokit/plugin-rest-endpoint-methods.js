# Get contextual information for a user

Provides hovercard information when authenticated through basic auth or OAuth with the `repo` scope. You can find out more about someone in relation to their pull requests, issues, repositories, and organizations.

The `subject_type` and `subject_id` parameters provide context for the person's hovercard, which returns more information than without the parameters. For example, if you wanted to find out more about `octocat` who owns the `Spoon-Knife` repository via cURL, it would look like this:

```shell
 curl -u username:token
  https://api.github.com/users/octocat/hovercard?subject_type=repository&subject_id=1300192
```

```js
octokit.users.getContextForUser({
  username
});
```
