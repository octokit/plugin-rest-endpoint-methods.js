# List organizations

Lists all organizations, in the order that they were created on GitHub.

**Note:** Pagination is powered exclusively by the `since` parameter. Use the [Link header](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api#using-link-headers) to get the URL for the next page of organizations.

```js
octokit.rest.orgs.list();
```

## Parameters

    <tr>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>required</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>since</td><td>no</td><td>

An organization ID. Only return organizations with an ID greater than this ID.

The number of results per page (max 100). For more information, see "[Using pagination in the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."
