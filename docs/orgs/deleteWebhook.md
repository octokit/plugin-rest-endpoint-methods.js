webhooks that they did not create and users cannot list, view, or edit webhooks that were created by OAuth apps.

```js
octokit.rest.orgs.deleteWebhook({
  org,
  hook_id,
});
```

  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>org</td><td>yes</td><td>

</td></tr>
<tr><td>hook_id</td><td>yes</td><td>

The unique identifier of the hook. You can find this value in the `X-GitHub-Hook-ID` header of a webhook delivery.
