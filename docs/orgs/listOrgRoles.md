# Get all organization roles for an organization

Lists the organization roles available in this organization. For more information on organization roles, see "[Using organization roles](https://docs.github.com/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/using-organization-roles)."

To use this endpoint, the authenticated user must be one of:

- An administrator for the organization.
- A user, or a user on a team, with the fine-grained permissions of `read_organization_custom_org_role` in the organization.

OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:org` scope to use this endpoint.

```js
octokit.rest.orgs.listOrgRoles({
  org,
});
```

    </tr>
  </thead>
