# List organizations for the authenticated user

List organizations for the authenticated user.

**OAuth scope requirements**

This only lists organizations that your authorization allows you to operate on in some way (e.g., you can list teams with `read:org` scope, you can publicize your organization membership with `user` scope, etc.). Therefore, this API requires at least `user` or `read:org` scope. OAuth requests with insufficient scope receive a `403 Forbidden` response.

```js
octokit.rest.orgs.listForAuthenticatedUser();
```

## Parameters

      <th>description</th>
