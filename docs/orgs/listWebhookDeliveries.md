# List deliveries for an organization webhook

Returns a list of webhook deliveries for a webhook configured in an organization.

You must be an organization owner to use this endpoint.

OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need `admin:org_hook` scope. OAuth apps cannot list, view, or edit
webhooks that they did not create and users cannot list, view, or edit webhooks that were created by OAuth apps.

```js
octokit.rest.orgs.listWebhookDeliveries({
  org,
  hook_id,
});
```
