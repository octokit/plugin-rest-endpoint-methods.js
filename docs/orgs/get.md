# Get an organization

To see many of the organization response values, you need to be an authenticated organization owner with the `admin:org` scope. When the value of `two_factor_requirement_enabled` is `true`, the organization requires all members, billing managers, and outside collaborators to enable [two-factor authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/).

GitHub Apps with the `Organization plan` permission can use this endpoint to retrieve information about an organization's GitHub plan. See "[Authenticating with GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/)" for details. For an example response, see 'Response with GitHub plan information' below."

```js
octokit.rest.orgs.get({
  org,
});
```

## Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>required</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>org</td><td>yes</td><td>

</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
