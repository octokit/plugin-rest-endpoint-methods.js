# Get team membership for a user

Team members will include the members of child teams.

To get a user's membership with a team, the team must be visible to the authenticated user.

**Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `GET /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/memberships/{username}`.

**Note:**
The response contains the `state` of the membership and the member's `role`.

The `role` for organization owners is set to `maintainer`. For more information about `maintainer` roles, see see [Create a team](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest//rest/reference/teams#create-a-team).

octokit.rest.teams.getMembershipForUserInOrg({
