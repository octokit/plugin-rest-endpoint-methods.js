# List teams for the authenticated user

List all of the teams across all of the organizations to which the authenticated user belongs. This method requires `user`, `repo`, or `read:org` [scope](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/) when authenticating via [OAuth](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/). When using a fine-grained personal access token, the resource owner of the token [must be a single organization](https://docs.github.com/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#fine-grained-personal-access-tokens), and have at least read-only member organization permissions. The response payload only contains the teams from a single organization when using a fine-grained personal access token.

```js
octokit.rest.teams.listForAuthenticatedUser();
```
