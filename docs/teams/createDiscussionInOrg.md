# Create a discussion

Creates a new discussion post on a team's page. OAuth access tokens require the `write:discussion` [scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/).

This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://help.github.com/articles/about-notifications/). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in abuse rate limiting. See "[Abuse rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/#abuse-rate-limits)" and "[Dealing with abuse rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/best-practices-for-integrators/#dealing-with-abuse-rate-limits)" for details.

**Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `POST /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/discussions`.

```js
octokit.teams.createDiscussionInOrg({
  org,
  team_slug,
  title,
  body,
});
```
