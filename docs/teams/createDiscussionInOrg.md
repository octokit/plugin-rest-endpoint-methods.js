# Create a discussion

Creates a new discussion post on a team's page. OAuth access tokens require the `write:discussion` [scope](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/).

This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. See "[Secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#secondary-rate-limits)" and "[Dealing with secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-integrators#dealing-with-secondary-rate-limits)" for details.

**Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `POST /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/discussions`.

```js
octokit.rest.teams.createDiscussionInOrg({
  org,
  team_slug,
  title,
  body,
});
```
