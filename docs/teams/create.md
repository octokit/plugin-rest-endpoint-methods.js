# Create team

To create a team, the authenticated user must be a member or owner of `:org`. By default, organization members can create teams. Organization owners can limit team creation to organization owners. For more information, see "[Setting team creation permissions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-team-creation-permissions-in-your-organization)."

When you create a new team, you automatically become a team maintainer without explicitly adding yourself to the optional array of `maintainers`. For more information, see "[About teams](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-teams)" in the GitHub Help documentation.

```js
octokit.teams.create({
  org,
  name
});
```
