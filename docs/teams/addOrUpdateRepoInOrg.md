# Add or update team repository

To add a repository to a team or update the team's permission on a repository, the authenticated user must have admin access to the repository, and must be able to see the team. The repository must be owned by the organization, or a direct fork of a repository owned by the organization. You will get a `422 Unprocessable Entity` status if you attempt to add a repository to a team that is not owned by the organization. Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see "[HTTP verbs](https://developer.github.com/v3/#http-verbs)."

**Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `PUT /organizations/:org_id/team/:team_id/repos/:owner/:repo`.

```js
octokit.teams.addOrUpdateRepoInOrg({
  org,
  team_slug,
  owner,
  repo
});
```
