# Check team permissions for a repository

Checks whether a team has `admin`, `push`, `maintain`, `triage`, or `pull` permission for a repository. Repositories inherited through a parent team will also be checked.

You can also get information about the specified repository, including what permissions the team grants on it, by passing the following custom [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/) via the `application/vnd.github.v3.repository+json` accept header.

If a team doesn't have permission for the repository, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response status.

**Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `GET /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/repos/{owner}/{repo}`.

```js
octokit.rest.teams.checkPermissionsForRepoInOrg({
  org,
  team_slug,
  owner,
  repo,
});
```
