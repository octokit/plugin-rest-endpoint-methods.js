# Update Git LFS preference

You can import repositories from Subversion, Mercurial, and TFS that include files larger than 100MB. This ability is powered by [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com). You can learn more about our LFS feature and working with large files [on our help site](https://docs.github.com/articles/versioning-large-files/).

```js
octokit.rest.migrations.setLfsPreference({
  owner,
  repo,
  use_lfs,
});
```
