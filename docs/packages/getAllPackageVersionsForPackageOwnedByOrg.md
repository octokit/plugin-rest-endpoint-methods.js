# List package versions for a package owned by an organization

Lists package versions for a package owned by an organization.

OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint if the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions. For the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."

```js
octokit.rest.packages.getAllPackageVersionsForPackageOwnedByOrg({
  package_type,
  package_name,
  org,
});
```
