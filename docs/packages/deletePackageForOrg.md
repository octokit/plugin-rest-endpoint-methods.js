# Delete a package for an organization

Deletes an entire package in an organization. You cannot delete a public package if any version of the package has more than 5,000 downloads. In this scenario, contact GitHub support for further assistance.

To use this endpoint, you must have admin permissions in the organization and authenticate using an access token with the `packages:read` and `packages:delete` scopes. In addition:

- If `package_type` is not `container`, your token must also include the `repo` scope.
- If `package_type` is `container`, you must also have admin permissions to the container you want to delete.

```js
octokit.rest.packages.deletePackageForOrg({
  package_type,
  package_name,
  org,
});
```
