# Get a package for an organization

Gets a specific package in an organization.

OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `read:packages` scope to use this endpoint. For more information, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."

```js
octokit.rest.packages.getPackageForOrganization({
  package_type,
  package_name,
  org,
});
```

      <th>description</th>
