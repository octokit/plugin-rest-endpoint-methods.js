# Delete a package for the authenticated user

Deletes a package owned by the authenticated user. You cannot delete a public package if any version of the package has more than 5,000 downloads. In this scenario, contact GitHub support for further assistance.

OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `read:packages` and `delete:packages` scopes to use this endpoint. If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions, `repo` scope is also required. For the list these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."

```js
octokit.rest.packages.deletePackageForAuthenticatedUser({
  package_type,
  package_name,
});
```

    <tr><td>package_type</td><td>yes</td><td>
