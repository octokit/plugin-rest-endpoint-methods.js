# Get a package version for a user

Gets a specific package version for a public package owned by a specified user.

At this time, to use this endpoint, you must authenticate using an access token with the `packages:read` scope.
If `package_type` is not `container`, your token must also include the `repo` scope.

```js
octokit.rest.packages.getPackageVersionForUser({
  package_type,
  package_name,
  package_version_id,
  username,
});
```

## Parameters

      <th>name</th>
      <th>required</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>package_type</td><td>yes</td><td>

The type of supported package. Can be one of `npm`, `maven`, `rubygems`, `nuget`, `docker`, or `container`. Packages in GitHub's Gradle registry have the type `maven`. Docker images pushed to GitHub's Container registry (`ghcr.io`) have the type `container`. You can use the type `docker` to find images that were pushed to GitHub's Docker registry (`docker.pkg.github.com`), even if these have now been migrated to the Container registry.
