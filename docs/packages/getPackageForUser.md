# Get a package for a user

Gets a specific package metadata for a public package owned by a user.

To use this endpoint, you must authenticate using an access token with the `read:packages` scope. If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions, your token must also include the `repo` scope. For the list of GitHub Packages registries that only support repository-scoped permissions, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."

```js
octokit.rest.packages.getPackageForUser({
  package_type,
  package_name,
  username,
});
```

## Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>required</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>package_type</td><td>yes</td><td>

The type of supported package. Packages in GitHub's Gradle registry have the type `maven`. Docker images pushed to GitHub's Container registry (`ghcr.io`) have the type `container`. You can use the type `docker` to find images that were pushed to GitHub's Docker registry (`docker.pkg.github.com`), even if these have now been migrated to the Container registry.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>package_name</td><td>yes</td><td>

The name of the package.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>username</td><td>yes</td><td>

The handle for the GitHub user account.
