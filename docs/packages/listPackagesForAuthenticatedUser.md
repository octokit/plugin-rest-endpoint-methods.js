# List packages for the authenticated user's namespace

Lists packages owned by the authenticated user within the user's namespace.

OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `read:packages` scope to use this endpoint. If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions, the `repo` scope is also required. For the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."

```js
octokit.rest.packages.listPackagesForAuthenticatedUser({
  package_type,
});
```

## Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>required</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>package_type</td><td>yes</td><td>

The type of supported package. Packages in GitHub's Gradle registry have the type `maven`. Docker images pushed to GitHub's Container registry (`ghcr.io`) have the type `container`. You can use the type `docker` to find images that were pushed to GitHub's Docker registry (`docker.pkg.github.com`), even if these have now been migrated to the Container registry.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>visibility</td><td>no</td><td>

The selected visibility of the packages. This parameter is optional and only filters an existing result set.

The `internal` visibility is only supported for GitHub Packages registries that allow for granular permissions. For other ecosystems `internal` is synonymous with `private`.
For the list of GitHub Packages registries that support granular permissions, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#granular-permissions-for-userorganization-scoped-packages)."

</td></tr>
<tr><td>page</td><td>no</td><td>

The page number of the results to fetch. For more information, see "[Using pagination in the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."

</td></tr>
<tr><td>per_page</td><td>no</td><td>

The number of results per page (max 100). For more information, see "[Using pagination in the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."

</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
