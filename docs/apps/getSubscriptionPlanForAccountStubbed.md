# Get a subscription plan for an account (stubbed)

Shows whether the user or organization account actively subscribes to a plan listed by the authenticated GitHub App. When someone submits a plan change that won't be processed until the end of their billing cycle, you will also see the upcoming pending change.

OAuth Apps must use [basic authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/#basic-authentication) with their client ID and client secret to access this endpoint.

```js
octokit.apps.getSubscriptionPlanForAccountStubbed({
  account_id,
});
```
