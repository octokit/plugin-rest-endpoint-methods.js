# List repositories accessible to the user access token

List repositories that the authenticated user has explicit permission (`:read`, `:write`, or `:admin`) to access for an installation.

The authenticated user has explicit permission to access repositories they own, repositories where they are a collaborator, and repositories that they can access through an organization membership.

The access the user has to each repository is included in the hash under the `permissions` key.

```js
octokit.rest.apps.listInstallationReposForAuthenticatedUser({
  installation_id,
});
```
