# List repositories accessible to the user access token

List repositories that the authenticated user has explicit permission (`:read`, `:write`, or `:admin`) to access for an installation.

The authenticated user has explicit permission to access repositories they own, repositories where they are a collaborator, and repositories that they can access through an organization membership.

You must use a [user access token](https://docs.github.com/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app), created for a user who has authorized your GitHub App, to access this endpoint.

The access the user has to each repository is included in the hash under the `permissions` key.

```js
octokit.rest.apps.listInstallationReposForAuthenticatedUser({
  installation_id,
});
```
