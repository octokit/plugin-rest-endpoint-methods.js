# Delete an installation for the authenticated app

Uninstalls a GitHub App on a user, organization, or business account. If you prefer to temporarily suspend an app's access to your account's resources, then we recommend the "[Suspend an app installation](https://docs.github.com/rest/apps/apps#suspend-an-app-installation)" endpoint.

You must use a [JWT](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app) to access this endpoint.

```js
octokit.rest.apps.deleteInstallation({
  installation_id,
});
```

## Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>required</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>installation_id</td><td>yes</td><td>

The unique identifier of the installation.

</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
