# List accounts for a plan

Returns user and organization accounts associated with the specified plan, including free plans. For per-seat pricing, you see the list of accounts that have purchased the plan, including the number of seats purchased. When someone submits a plan change that won't be processed until the end of their billing cycle, you will also see the upcoming pending change.
