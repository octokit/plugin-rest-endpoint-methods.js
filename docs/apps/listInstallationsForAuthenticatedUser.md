# List app installations accessible to the user access token

Lists installations of your GitHub App that the authenticated user has explicit permission (`:read`, `:write`, or `:admin`) to access.

The authenticated user has explicit permission to access repositories they own, repositories where they are a collaborator, and repositories that they can access through an organization membership.

You can find the permissions for the installation under the `permissions` key.

```js
octokit.rest.apps.listInstallationsForAuthenticatedUser();
```
